nPose Slave 0.030.002:                  

Bug Fixes:
 1. An unsuccessful test to check if AV was seated before animation layered animations.  The Slave will no longer attempt to impose a layered animation on a non-seated AV.
 
    
Version History:
nPose Slave 0.030.001:  
New Features:
 1. Handles facial animation times.  This is optional and continuous as the older way still works making it nice to mix the two features.  Use tilde delimited list with a time to run each in seconds as follows:
    express_shrug_emote=10~express_laugh_emote=3

nPose Slave 0.030:
    Same as 0.029.005.

nPose Slave 0.029.005:
  1. One Slave script is all that will be required to support virtually unlimited number of seated AV's.
  2. Layered animation support is now built into the slave script.
  3. Handling of offsets has been moved to this slave because it is lean enough on memory usage to handle the storage.
  4. The Slave script now handles building and sending seat# to the menu script. 

nPose Slave 0.028.001
    1.  Changed llSetLinkPrimitiveParams to llSetLinkPrimitiveParamsFast.  This is intended to make quicker, smoother pose changes.

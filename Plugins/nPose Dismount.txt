nPose Dismount Plugin .029.001:               

This is a way to control how the AV dismounts nPose.

Dependencies:
This plugin requres the use of the nPose (V) version of scripts.

Bug Fix:
1.  Modified to receive seat update from the Ash core version.
2.  Ensure that no attempt will be made to unsit an Avatar that is not seated.


To use:
Build a SET notecard and add the Animation or Pose of your choosing.  
Set position and rotation to your liking.
Add a link message line as the last line of the notecard. (LINKMSG|-221|1~2~3~4) Where the ~'d list of numbers are the seat numbers where the AV is you intend to have stand.  In this case, 4 seated AV's will stand in their own spot at the same time.

For this demo I have used a pose which was donated to nPose by RohanaRaven Zerbino of  [RNP] Animations & Sculpts

nPose PropTouch Menu Relay  0.028:                  

Add this script to any prop where you would like to pull the main nPose menu by touching the prop.  In this case where I have a blanket prop that covers much of my bed, I can get the nPose menu by clicking the blanket.  Very useful in some situations.

This is the initial release.

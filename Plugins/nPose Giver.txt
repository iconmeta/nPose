nPose Giver Script .004:               

New Features:
1.  Allow a list if items to be given.  The '~' delimited list can be defined within a BTN notecard.
2.  Allow the folder name to be defined.  The folder name can be defined within the BTN notecard.
3.  Display a dialog with seated AV names for nPose menu user to select from to become the receiver of these items..  If there are no seated AV's, then the menu toucher becomes the receiver of these items.
4.  Optional provide a notecard with the list of items to be given.  LL has a limit to the length of the text that can be sent via link message so a long list will not all be sent.  The optional notecard will key off the giver script to read that notecard to get the list thus getting around the LL limit.
    a.  The name of the notecard containing the list of items must be the same name as the folder that the receiver AV will be getting.
    b.  If the optional notecard is used, the list of items within the BTN notecard are not included (no '~' delimited list).
5.  The Giver plugin will announce in local to the receiver who sent the items and the name of the folder where these items can be found in their inventory.

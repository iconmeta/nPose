nPose v0.028.RC License/Authorization for use:
-------------------------------------------

The nPose scripts are licensed under the GPLv2 (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.txt), with the following addendum:

The nPose scripts are free to be copied, modified, and redistributed, subject to the following conditions:
    - If you distribute the nPose scripts, you must leave them full perms.
    - If you modify the nPose scripts and distribute the modifications, you must also make your modifications full perms.

"Full perms" means having the modify, copy, and transfer permissions enabled in Second Life and/or other virtual world platforms derived from Second Life (such as OpenSim).  If the platform should allow more fine-grained permissions, then "full perms" will mean the most permissive possible set of permissions allowed by the platform.

Scripts which communicate with the nPose scripts only through link messages are not subject to the above restrictions.
